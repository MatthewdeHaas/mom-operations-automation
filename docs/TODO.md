# TODO


### Clean up + Generalise
- [x] Database tables should be named based on their week
- [x] Functions that produce the tables should handle any sheet via the url
- [x] Wrap general utility into one parameterized function

### Website
- [ ] Add Flask boilerplate and link to the database used for storing tables currently
- [ ] Add basic front-end functionality and implement database reads/writes from the website instead of just running a python file

### Hosting
- [ ] Add 'mom-operations' as a subdomain to my personal website
